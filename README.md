# Calculator: The Game Solver
Automatically solves any puzzle in the game Calculator: The Game through a recursive brute-force algorithm.

DO NOT USE THIS BEFORE GIVING EACH PUZZLE A TRY

Once you find the solution to a puzzle, you can't forget it. The joy in the puzzle is gone.


This program implements every static operation currently in the game, including Store, making it quick to use.
I plan to support dynamic operations, portals, and static text in the future.

The solution will be given in the form of a list of numbers. Each number corresponds to an index of the original operations list argument. Enter each operation given by the indices in the order of the solution list to solve it.

In order to use store, both store and insStore must be used, as both operations are represented with the single "Store" button in-game.
